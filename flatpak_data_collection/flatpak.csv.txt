# Flatpak analytics
	- 
data analisys
(some examples)
		- answer some questions
			- what errors most occur with my app
				- what's the hardware was used when it occurried
			- a lot of issues of my app is about performance.
				- What is the hardware people generaly use
		- about hardware/ software and configurations
			- I am currently unable to maintain my app as it has a wide range of hardaware that it has to support and it takes too much of my time. I need to choose something to focus on.
				- as my app has an free and open license, if someone wants, they can fork to support these old hardwares
			- I'm constantly recieving issues about performance.
				- let me see the common erros in the logs and relate to the hardware/ software/ config to see if I can find any incompatibility
		- abou logs
			- I'm constantly recieving issues about a feature in my app. What are a constant error message?
				- Is this hardware related?
			- for how long or how many times people use my app daily? Is it more or less than before?
				- What can I do to improve? What are the common requests of users? What is the profile of people who use my app?
		- about user info
			- what is the profile of people who use my app?
				- what can i do to reach more people?
				- I plan to add a feature X to my app. May this  negatively influence the consumers?
	- how would it work?
		- user can choose to flatpak to send the report
			- automatcally
			- only after user review
				- prompt user periodically
				- on demand
			- never
		- user can enable/ disable all infos to send at anytime
			- one by one
			- all at once
			- for one app
			- for all apps at once
		- the report is read only for the user
			- to try to prevent fake info
		- user can preview or export the report on demand
			- to send a issue to the developer, for example
		- all the info given should respect the privacy laws
			- all info should be anonimous
		- it would be a portal to system
			- the developer must specify what information will be requested by default
				- the users configuration should override the requested info without additional configuration
	- data
		- additional info
(user input)
			- sex
			- age
				- the user may give the date of birth
					- so it can update automatically
					- the app can only acess the year (or age)
			- ethny?
			- ...
		- user info
(internet)
			- country
		- hardware/ software
(e.g neofetch+something)
			- CPU model
			- GPU model
			- memory size
			- memory speed
			- HD or SSD speed
			- monitor resolution
			- OS
			- Kernel
			- DE
			- WM
			- WM Theme
			- Theme
			- Icons
		- log id
			- relates to the log info
		- system log
(e.g. journalctl)
			- grep appID
			- sed $USER HIDDEN
			- user add rules
				- info hidden
					- grep -v
					- terms
					- hide all lines of the log that matches a term
				- info anonimized
					- sed term HIDDEN
					- replace the term with a defaut string as "HIDDEN", to mantain anonymity, but still give the developer the info of the matching lines
	- why
		- create a stardard way to developers to collect data
			- it may discourage developers to create or mantain in it's code a way to collect data
				- from a random developer it may
					- implement in a insecure way
					- disrespect the user's privacy
						- without user consent
				- because
					- may take efford to upgrade an app and mantain some features
					- the tool will already exist natively
		- give the developers tools to improve user experience
		- create a differencial to flatpaks
			- more developers may be interest to port to flatpak
			- and upload to flathub
		- flathub can implement useful dashboards by default
			- and charge for the dashboard?
